Bambi is a high-level Bayesian model-building interface written in Python. It works with the probabilistic programming frameworks `PyMC3 <https://docs.pymc.io/>`__ and is designed to make it extremely easy to fit Bayesian mixed-effects models common in biology, social sciences and other disciplines.


Dependencies
============
Bambi is tested on Python 3.7+ and depends on ArviZ, formulae, NumPy, pandas, PyMC3 and statsmodels (see `requirements.txt <https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/blob/main/requirements.txt>`_ for version information).

Installation
============

Bambi is available from the Python Package Index at `<https://pypi.org/project/bambi/>`_, alternatively it can be installed using Conda.

PyPI
----

The latest release of Bambi can be installed using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install bambi

Alternatively, if you want the bleeding edge version of the package, you can install from GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git


Conda
-----

If you use Conda, you can also install the latest release of Bambi with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge bambi


Usage
=====
A simple fixed effects model is shown in the example below.

.. code-block:: python

    import arviz as az
    import bambi as bmb
    import pandas as pd

    # Read in a tab-delimited file containing our data
    data = pd.read_table('my_data.txt', sep='\t')

    # Initialize the fixed effects only model
    model = bmb.Model('DV ~ IV1 + IV2', data)

    # Fit the model using 1000 on each of 4 chains
    results = model.fit(draws=1000, chains=4)

    # Use ArviZ to plot the results
    az.plot_trace(results)

    # Key summary and diagnostic info on the model parameters
    az.summary(results)
