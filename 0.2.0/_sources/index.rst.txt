Bambi is a high-level Bayesian model-building interface written in Python. It works with two probabilistic programming frameworks, `PyMC3 <https://docs.pymc.io/>`__ or `PyStan <https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, and is designed to make it extremely easy to fit Bayesian mixed-effects models common in biology, social sciences and other disciplines.

New Features
============

Bambi version ``0.1.1`` will be the final version supporting Python 2, but look forward to the forthcoming Bambi version ``0.1.2``!

Dependencies
============
Bambi is tested on Python 3.6 and depends on NumPy, Pandas, PyMC3, PyStan, Patsy and ArviZ (see `requirements.txt <https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/blob/master/requirements.txt>`_ for version information).

Installation
============
The latest release of Bambi can be installed using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install bambi

Alternatively, if you want the bleeding edge version of the package, you can install from GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git

Usage
=====
A simple fixed effects model is shown below as example.

.. code-block:: python

    from bambi import Model
    import pandas as pd

    # Read in a tab-delimited file containing our data
    data = pd.read_table('my_data.txt', sep='\t')

    # Initialize the model
    model = Model(data)

    # Fixed effects only model
    results = model.fit('DV ~ IV1 + IV2', samples=1000, chains=4)

    # Use ArviZ to plot the results
    az.plot_trace(results)

    # Key summary and diagnostic info on the model parameters
    az.summary(results)

    # Drop the first 100 samples (burn-in)
    results_bi = results.sel(draw=slice(100, None))
